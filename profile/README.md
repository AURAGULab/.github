## Start of readme for lab github page
### To do:

1. Create project repositories
  1. Projects
  2. CAD
  3. PCB (Should 2 and 3 fall under each project?)
2. Create readme files for each project
3. Create presentations directories
4. Create people page(s?)
5. Do we start a wiki?

The is the profile page, it exists in .github/profile, and whatever is in this markdown file will display on the organizational public profile page.

# Welcome! 👋

**The Augusta Ragu Lab** is an Augusta University research group that developes open source water quaility and smart city sensors. Throught he use of physics, electronics, and engineering we are able to produce unique and effective solutions to   We work jointly with, and are funded by, Augusta Utilities. In this lab we focus on the developement of our students. By introducing them to real world problems in the water/utiliy industry and

Seepage is defined as the slow leaking of a liquid through a pourus material. This event can lead to detramental consequences when it goes unmonitored in a dam. Currently, the way of monitoring this requires personnel to go out and observe each location and note what they see. To optimise this process, we developed a camera system to deploy in multiple locations along the Augusta canal. This allows us remotely monitor these sites and establish long term data. This device uses wireless communications and solar charging to makes it suitable for long term deployement. We have coined this solution as SMAC (Seepage Monitoring at the Augusta Canal).
